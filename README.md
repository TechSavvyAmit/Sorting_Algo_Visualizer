## 📊 Algorithms Implemented

- **Bubble Sort:** Iteratively compares adjacent elements, swapping those in the wrong order. Best for small or nearly sorted datasets.
  
- **Selection Sort:** Finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element. Consistent performance across inputs.
  
- **Insertion Sort:** Builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting each element in its correct position. Great for small datasets.
  
- **Merge Sort:** Recursively divides the array and merges them back after sorting. Efficient and stable with O(n log n) time complexity.
  
- **Quick Sort:** Selects a pivot and partitions the array into two sub-arrays. Highly efficient but can degrade to O(n²) with poor pivot choices.

## 🎨 Color-Coded Visualization

- **🔵 Blue:** Default state
- **🟡 Yellow:** Elements being compared
- **🔴 Red:** Elements in incorrect positions
- **🟢 Green:** Elements in correct positions

## 🎛️ Controls

- **Speed Control:** Adjust the visualization speed with six levels.
- **Data Size Control:** Set the size of the dataset to visualize different sorting speeds and complexities.
- **New Data:** Generate a new random dataset to visualize the sorting process again.
